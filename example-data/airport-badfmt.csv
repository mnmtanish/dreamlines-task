Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few.","","","","9.0","5.0","5.0","","","","a4.0","","","1"

The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.","","","","9.0","5.0","4.0","","","","4.0","","","1"

Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance. Most people travel domestic to Copenhagen but a rising number of international routes e.g. AAL-AMS makes for a lot of possibilities. Check-in is very quick and so is Security. All in all a nice experience.","","","","9.0","5.0","5.0","","","","4.0","","","1"

Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.","","","","5.0","5.0","5.0","","","","3.0","","","0"
"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","K Fischer","","2010-08-04","Very quick check-inn and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.","","","","4.0","","","","","","","","","0"
"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","M Larsen","","2009-03-26","Aalborg Lufthavn (AAL) is a smallish airport near the city of Aalborg. There is not usually a lot of people leaving or arriving at any one time so there is hardly ever any time wasted standing in line for check-in or security checks - brilliant! A very friendly and inviting atmosphere overall.","","","","5.0","","","","","","","","","0"

SAS and Maersk are the only operators using it besides a few private owners and charter airlines. Use it only if you have to! If there's no taxi waiting outside it is difficult to go to the city centre. The only reason this airport exists is to serve passengers who fly abroad especially via CPH.","","","","1.0","","","","","","","","","0"

All very efficient when I went through.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"
